## Overview
If you've never used latex before, or if you want to see examples of latex
features you're not too familiar with - my hope is that this will be a goto
resource for you. I don't claim to know everything about latex - I only started
using it consistently in fall 2019 - however I like to think that I know
enough to get the job done quickly and make my assignments look fairly
professional. This project includes a sample tex file with the purpose to share
my knowledge with you in the form of basic examples that you can use as a
reference.

Good luck and happy texing :~)
